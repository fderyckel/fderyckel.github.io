One of the main pillar of quantitative finance is the assumption that assets' returns behave in a random manner.  Assets returns are normally distributed.  It is a poor assumption as asset's return are usually not normally distributed (fat tails, skewness, etc.), but it is one that is considered when approaching finance with a quantitative finance. 

# Discrete approach  

$$R_i = \frac{S_{i+1}-S_i}{S_i}$$ {#eq-ret1}
$$\bar{R} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i}{n}$$

* $R_i$ = return of an asset at time i
* $S_i$ = price of an asset at time i

If returns are normally distributed, we could re-write @eq-ret1 as 
$$R_i = \frac{S_{i+1} - S_i}{S_i} = \bar{R} + Std \phi$$ {#eq-ret2}

* Std of returns (Std): $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(R_i - \bar{R})^2}$
* $\phi$ is just a number taken from the normal distribution with mean = 0 and std = 1 
* $\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot e^{- \frac{x^2}{2}}$ 

# Continuous approach 

Returns should scale with time. 

Mean returns = $\mu \cdot \delta t$

* $\mu$ = Annualized means returns on a continuous basis (usually not known, or hard to know)
* $\delta t$ = a small time increment 

## Ignoring randomness 

$$R_i = \frac{S_{i+1} - S_i}{S_i} = mean  = \mu \delta t$$
$$S_{i+1} - S_i= S_i \mu \delta t$$ 
$$S_{i+1} = S_i \cdot (1 +  \mu \delta t)$$ {#eq-asset-price1}


We could also rewrite @eq-asset-price1 so it depends of the initial (starting) price, instead of the previous price.  

$$S_n = S_0 (1+\mu \delta t)^n$$

Using natural log: 

$S_n = S_0 e^{log (1+\mu \delta t)^n} = S_0 e^{n \cdot log{(1+\mu \delta t)}}$ 

We could argue that $log(1+\mu \delta t) \approx \mu \delta t$ as $log(1+x) \approx x$ for small values of x. 

$$S_n \approx S_0 \cdot e^{n \mu \delta t}$$ {#eq-asset-price2} 

Now, $n \cdot \delta t$ is the same as $t$.  Hence, 

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
$$S(t) \approx S_0 \cdot e^{\mu t}$$ 
::: 

## Considering randomness 

Let's restart with @eq-ret2

$$R_i = \frac{S_{i+1} - S_i}{S_i} = \bar{R} + std \cdot \phi = \mu \delta t + \sigma \phi \delta t^{1/2}$$
$$S_{i+1} - S_i= S_i \mu \delta t + S_i \sigma \phi \delta t^{1/2}$$ {#eq-asset-price2}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} 
$$S_{i+1} = S_i \cdot (1 +  \mu \delta t) + S_i \sigma \phi \delta t^{1/2}$$ {#eq-asset-price3}

This last @eq-asset-price3 is the basis for Monte-Carlo simulation. 

* Notice the standard deviation of return: $\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}$
* unit of $\mu = \frac{1}{t}$ 
* unit of $\sigma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$
* this is because we can only variance together (no sd).  For independent variable X and Y: $Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)$
* the standard deviation of returns scale up with the square root of the time step. 
:::

## Going to continuous time 

Restarting from @eq-asset-price2 : 
$$S_{i+1} - S_i= S_i \mu \delta t + S_i \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} \phi$$ 

* $S_{i+1} - S_i = dS$
* $S_i = S(t)$
* $\delta t = dt$ 
* $\phi \sqrt{\delta t} = dX$ where $dX$ is a random variable with mean = 0 and variance = dt.  Hence $E[dX] = 0$ and $E[(dX)^2] = dt$ 

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
$$dS = S \mu dt + S \sigma dX$$ 
This stochastic differential equation on the change of prices assume: 

* returns are treated as random 
* returns are assumed to be normally distributed (again not totally exact) 
* prices (S) are modelled as a log-normal walk (SDE) 
* $\mu$ is the drift rate or growth rate 
* because of the different scaling of time ($t$ and $\sqrt{t}$), on a short time frame, drift is negligible and volatility matters.

# Practice in R 

Let's use the above notes with the ticker SBUX as a financial asset.   

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(readr)    # read_csv()
library(dplyr)    # select(), filter(), mutate()
library(tidyr)    #drop_na()

df <- read_csv('../../raw_data/SBUX.csv') |> 
  select(date, adjClose) |> 
  filter(date > '2019-10-01') |> drop_na() |>
  mutate(ret = (adjClose - lag(adjClose)) / lag(adjClose))

r_bar = mean(df$ret, na.rm = T)
stdev = sd(df$ret, na.rm = T)

mu = r_bar / (1/252)
sigma = stdev / sqrt(1/252)

r_bar
stdev
```

Knowing the average daily return of SBUX over the last 3-ish year and using $\bar{R} = \mu \delta t$ , or $\mu = \frac{\bar{R}}{\delta t}$ and in our case $\delta t = \frac{1}{252}$; we find the average annualized returns $\mu$ is: `r round(mu, 5) * 100` % with standard deviation $\sigma$ of `r round(sigma, 3) * 100` % annualized. 

We could plot the returns and the std of returns

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df |> drop_na(), aes(x = date, y = ret)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = stdev, linetype = 'dotted', color = 'red', linewidth= 0.8) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = -stdev, linetype = 'dotted', color = 'red', linewidth = 0.8) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2*stdev, linetype = 'dotted', color = 'red', linewidth= 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = -2*stdev, linetype = 'dotted', color = 'red', linewidth = 1) + 
  xlab(label = 'Date') + ylab(label = 'Daily returns') + 
  labs(title = 'Daily returns')
```

We could standardized the returns (aka ensure they have a mean = 0 and std = 1) and compare it to the standard normal distribution. 

```{r}
#| warning: false
df1 <- df |> 
  mutate(std_ret = (ret - r_bar) / stdev) |> 
  drop_na()

ggplot(df1, aes(std_ret)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = 0.3, fill = 'blue', binwidth = 0.5) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), color = 'red', size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-5, 5), n.breaks = 9)
```

This graph exemplifies what is very common with asset returns: fat tail, and under representation of returns just outside the mean.
