This post is about summarizing the various statistical moments when analyzing stock returns. 

We'll show these parameters using both R and python.  


# Using R


# Using Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

amd = pd.read_csv('../../raw_data/AMD.csv')

x = amd['Adj Close']

returns_21d = np.log(x / x.shift(21)).dropna()

mean_21dret = np.mean(returns_21d)
std_21dret = np.std(returns_21d)

print("The mean rolling 21 days return is: %s" % round(mean_21dret, 5))
print("The standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: %s" %round(std_21dret, 5))
```

The standard deviation is quite bigger than the mean.  An histogram of the returns will confirm that. 

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(returns_21d, bins = 'rice', label = 'Rolling 21-days return')
plt.show()
```

We are seeing a large left tail with indeed the mean looking around 0. 
An other to visualize this and putting emphasis on the outliers would be to plot the returns on a box-and-whiskers plot. 

```{python}
plt.boxplot(returns_21d, labels = ['Rolling 21-days return'])
plt.show()
```

# Skewness 

Skewness is measure of asymmetry of a distribution (or actually lack of).  How symmetric around the mean is the distribution? 
A standard normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and has zero skew. Other examples of zero-skewed distributions are the T Distribution, the uniform distribution and the Laplace distribution. However, other distributions don’t have zero skew. 

In a zero skew distribution, the mean = the median. 

:::

```{python}
from scipy.stats import skew, skewtest

skew(returns_21d)
```

The skew value is quite large and negative which confirms the fat left tail we saw on the histogram 

```{python}
skewtest(returns_21d)
```

Very small p-value.  We reject the null-hypothesis.  The distribution is not symetrical. 



 kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures "tailedness," not "peakedness."
