I am storing here a few nuggets of algebra, I need for quantitative finance and machine learning.  

# $e^x$ as an infinite serie 

Using the McLaurin series expansion, we can define $e^x$ as an infinite sum.  
Here is how it goes: 
$$e^x \approx f(0) + f'(0) \frac{x}{1} + f''(0) \frac{x^2}{2!} + f'''(0) \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots + f^n(0) \frac{x^n}{n!}$$

As $f(0) = f'(0) = f''(0) = f^n(0) = e^0 = 1$, we can rewrite our previous expression as 

$$e^x \approx 1 + \frac{x}{1} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}$$

Hence: $$e^x \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$
