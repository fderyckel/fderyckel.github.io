Auto-correlation as the name indicates is the correlation of the time-serie with itself ... well, with a lag version of itself. 

Let's consider $\{X_t\}$ a time series.  

*   Then the mean function of $\{X_t\}$ (the first moment) is defined as $\mu_t = \textbf{E}(X_t)$.  In other words, $\mu_t$ is the expected value of the time series at point t.  
*   The Variance of the time series is defined as $\sigma_t ^2 = Var(X_t) = \textbf{E}[(X_t - \mu_t)^2]$. 
*   In general, $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t ^2$ are different at different point in time. 

Now, we define the **autocovariance** function of the time series as $$\gamma(s, t) = Cov(X_s, X_t) = \textbf{E}[(X_s - \mu_s)(X_t - \mu_t)]$$. 
In the same vein, we define the autocorrelation function of the time series as 
$$\rho(s,t) = Corr(X_s, X_t) = \frac {\gamma (s, t)}{\sigma_s \sigma_t} = \frac{Cov(X_s, X_t)}{\sqrt{Var(X_s) Var(X_t)}}$$
