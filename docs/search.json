I created 2 companies in Zambia: a fruits farm and a fresh produce trading company.\n\nLived in Paris, France, for 2 years to complete my undergrad and start my master\nLived in Freiburg & Leipzig, Germany, for 3 years to complete my master and do some teaching gigs at Alliance Française, Leipzig Universitat and Leipzig International School\nLived in Dhaka, Bangladesh for 3 years to teach at the International School Dhaka\nLived in Zambia for 9 years to teach math, stats and philosophy at the American International School of Lusaka. I also started a citrus & mangoes farm (over 9,000 trees) and a produce (fresh fish, fruits, and meat) trading company\nLived Thuwal, Saudi Arabia on the shore of the beautiful Red Sea for 5 years. I worked as math teacher on the KAUST university Campus at TKS (The KAUST School)\nCurrently living in Bangkok (Thailand) as a curriculum coordinator for the KIS School.\n\nAs a teacher, I’m always looking for good examples to incorporate in my practices. Lately I am especially interested in machine learning applications in finance and education.\n\n\nEducation\n\nMaster in Philosophy, 2001\nParis I - Pantheon Sorbonne\n\n\nBachelor in Logic, 2000\nParis I - Pantheon Sorbonne\n\n\nBachelor in Philosophy, 1999\nParis I - Pantheon Sorbonne\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nForecasting, modeling and machine learning\nMath education\nOutdoor Living and active lifestyle (Swimming, Cycling, Running)"

An absorbing Markov chain has at least one absorbing state.\nA state is termed reflecting if once the chain leaves it, it cannot return to it.\nThe period d of a state i is the number such that, starting in i, the chain can return to i only in the number of steps that are multiples of d. A state with period d = 1 is called aperiodic. Periodicity is a class property.\n\nFor a reflecting state, the period is infinite, since the chain never comes back to this state.\nAbsorbing states necessarily have loops and thus are aperiodic states.\n\na state is called recurrent if with probability 1 the chain ever reenters that state. Otherwise, the state is called transient.\nA Markov Chain that has a unique stationary distribution (or steady-state distribution) is called an ergodic chain."

Hence, \\[\\Pi = V - \\Delta \\cdot S\\] At this stage, we are assuming that the probability to go up or down is the same (it’s basically irrelevant in this case).\n\n\n\nOption value with delta hedging\n\n\nIf we want to hedge the stock to be risk-free, then at expiration we should have this equation\n\\[V^+ - \\Delta us = V^--\\Delta vs\\] Solving for \\(\\Delta\\), we get:\n\\[\\Delta = \\frac{V^+-V^-}{(u-v)S} = \\frac{\\text{range of options payoff}}{\\text{range of asset prices}} \\tag{1}\\]\nIn other words, we could see \\(\\Delta\\) as the rate of change of the option price in function of the stock price. \\(\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial{V}}{\\partial{S}}\\)\nOnce we found \\(\\Delta\\), we could find \\(V\\) by just making today’s value of the trade = tomorrow’s value of the trade (at expiration). Just solve for \\(V\\) \\[V - \\Delta S = V^- - \\Delta vS\\] or \\[V - \\Delta S = V^+ - \\Delta uS\\] which ever is easier to calculate.\nNow, of course, cash is not free and there is a time value associated to it. In that sense, today’s value for the trade should be equal a discounted value of tomorrow’s trade value (at expiration).\nThe thinking is that if we want to hedge to be risk-free, it should return the risk-free rate otherwise there is an arbitrate opportunity. \\[\\Pi = V - \\Delta S = \\frac{1}{1+r \\delta t} \\left(V^- - \\Delta vS \\right)\\]\n\n\\(r\\) is the value of the risk-free asset\nwe are dealing with annualized values, if assets expires in one month and risk-free asset is let’s say 3%, we would multiply 3% by 21 days or \\(0.03 \\cdot \\frac{21}{252}\\)\n\nUsing our value of \\(\\Delta\\) from Equation 1, we can isolate \\(V\\) as \\[V = \\left(\\frac{V^+-V^-}{u-v} \\right) + \\frac{1}{1+r \\delta t} \\left(V^- - \\Delta vS \\right) \\tag{2}\\]\nWith delta-hedging, we say that the portfolio is deterministic (aka risk-free)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA stock is trading at $100. A call option with strike price of $100. Stock can either go to $103 or $98.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR \n  100 --&gt; 103\n  100 --&gt; 98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(V^+ = 3\\)\n\\(V^- = 0\\)\n\\(\\Delta = \\frac{3-0}{103-98} = \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n\\(V - \\Delta S = V^+ - \\Delta us\\), plugging the value from above we get \\(V = \\$1.2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the same idea as earlier and introducing some probabilities. \\(p'\\) is the risk-neutral probability.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  S -- p' --&gt; uS\n  S -- 1-p' --&gt; vS\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a probabilistic perspective we could write: \\[S = p'uS + (1-p')vS\\] Or in the presence of a risk free asset, \\[S = \\frac{1}{1+r \\delta t} \\left(p' uS + (1-p')vS \\right)\\]\nWe could isolate \\(p'\\) in this last equation: \\[s + s r \\delta t = p' u s + vs - p'v s\\] \\[p' = \\frac{s + s r \\delta t - vs}{us - vs}\\] \\[p' = \\frac{1+r \\delta t - v}{u-v} \\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  V -- p' --&gt; V+\n  V -- 1-p' --&gt; V-\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find \\(V\\): \\[V = p' V^+ + (1-p') V^-\\]\nInteresting to note that the option price \\(V\\) is like an expectation (the sum of the probability) and \\(p'\\) is from Equation 3\nActually, we should also include the discounted factor (V is the present value of the expectation): \\[V = \\frac{1}{1 + r \\delta t} \\cdot \\left( p' V^+ + (1-p') V^- \\right) \\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\nNow if we collide both world: the real-world with drift and volatility (Equation 2) and the risk-free world (Equation 4) with \\(p'\\): we can set up this 2 equations: One for the expected mean rate of change of prices and another for the variance of these rate of change.\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\begin{cases}\n    \\mu S \\delta t = puS+(1-p)vS-S \\\\\n    \\sigma^2S^2dt = S^2 (p \\cdot [u-1-(pu + (1-p)v-1)]^2 + (1-p) \\cdot [v-1-(pu + (1-p)v-1)]^2)\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n(TODO re-write these 2 equations)\n2 equations and 3 unknowns, we can choose a solution (the prettiest one!) among the infinitely many:\n\n\\(u = 1 + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta t}\\)\n\\(v = 1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta t}\\)\n\\(p = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\mu \\sqrt{\\delta t}}{2 \\sigma}\\)\n\\(p' = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{r \\sqrt{\\delta t}}{2 \\sigma}\\) \\(p'\\) is the risk-neutral probability."

In this case (y, t) are given, they are constant, they are known; while (y’, t’) are the variables.\nWe re-write this (Equation 4) for conciseness as \\(P(y, t; y', t')\\).\nHence, another way to write (Equation 4) is \\[P(y, t; y', t') = \\alpha \\cdot P(y, t; y'+\\delta y, t'-\\delta t) + (1-2\\alpha) P(y, t; y', t'-\\delta t) + \\alpha \\cdot P(y, t; y'-\\delta y, t' - \\delta t) \\tag{5}\\]\nEach terms in the sum of (Equation 5) could be evaluated using a Taylor Series Expansion.

There is this neat little alternative expression of variance (I like the way it sounds).\n\nVariance is the difference between the mean of the square and the square of the mean.\n\nHere is how it goes:\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{n} = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - 2 \\frac{\\sum(x_i \\mu)}{n} + \\frac{\\sum(\\mu)^2}{n}\\]\nConsidering\n\n\\(\\frac{\\sum(x_i \\mu)}{n} = \\mu \\frac{\\sum(x_i)}{n} = \\mu \\mu=\\mu^2\\)\nand considering \\(\\frac{\\sum(\\mu)^2}{n} = n \\frac{\\mu^2}{n} = \\mu^2\\), we can re-write our variance like this\n\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - 2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - \\mu^2\\]\n\n\nCoefficient of variation\nThe coefficient of variation is not a statistical moment, but considering it is the ratio of the first 2 moments (ratio of sd to the mean), we include it here as well. It allows to compare together 2 different distributions (that have different mean and sd).\n\\[CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\]\nOr in the case of a sample \\(CV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\nSkewness is measure of asymmetry of a distribution (or actually lack of). How symmetric around the mean is the distribution? A standard normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and has zero skew. Other examples of zero-skewed distributions are the T Distribution, the uniform distribution and the Laplace distribution. However, other distributions don’t have zero skew.\nIn a zero skew distribution, the mean = the median and the distribution is symmetric.\n\n\nIn a sense, skewness is quantifying for us how far is the median from the mean.\nMathematically, we define skewness as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^3}{\\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^3}} \\tag{1}\\]\nIn the case of a sample, we’ll multiply Equation 2 by a factor of \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2}\\)\n\nskenwess = 0 ==> normallly distributed\n$ -0.5 skewness $ ==> moderately skew\n$$\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\nKurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures “tailedness,” not “peakedness.”\n\n\nBecause, we raised the difference of a data point to its mean to the 4th power, it is really the data points far away from the mean that do participate to the kurtosis.\n\n“increasing kurtosis is associated with the “movement of probability mass from the shoulders of a distribution into its center and tails.” (Someone important who got published and knew his stuff!)\n\nMathematically, we define kurtosis as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^2} \\tag{2}\\]\nSome statistical packages are providing excess kurtosis by subtracting 3 to the kurtosis value. So for a data set that is perfectly normally distributed, we expect the excess kurtosis to be 0.\nThere are 3 categories of kurtosis: leptokurtic (positive excess kurtosis), mesokurtic (aka normal distribution), platykurtic. \n\nA kurtosis greater than 3 => leptokurtic\nA kurtosis around 3 => mesokurtic\nA kurtosis less than 3 => platykurtic\n\nA Student’s T distribution with degree of freedom 4 has infinite kurtosis (huge peak and tails + narrow shoulders)\nMost equities display a leptokurtic behavior (skinny at the mean - most returns are clustered around the mean) and narrow shoulders and fat tails.\n\n\nUsing Python\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\namd = pd.read_csv('../../raw_data/AMD.csv')\n\nx = amd['adjClose']\n\nreturns_21d = np.log(x / x.shift(21)).dropna()\n\nmean_21dret = np.mean(returns_21d)\nstd_21dret = np.std(returns_21d)\n\nprint(\"The mean rolling 21 days return is: %s\" % round(mean_21dret, 5))\n\nThe mean rolling 21 days return is: -0.00594\n\nprint(\"The standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: %s\" %round(std_21dret, 5))\n\nThe standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: 0.1832\n\n\nThe standard deviation is quite bigger than the mean.

To see the algorithm at work on some financial data, you can use the post on kmeans and regime change.\nAs mentioned, Kmeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm, aiming to group “observations” based on their distances to a fixed number of “centroids” (aka: the fixed number is K). Each centroids is defined as the mean (in each dimension) of all the points belonging to that centroid. All the points belonging to a centroid makes a cluster: all the observations belonging to the k-centroid makes the k-cluster.\nThe objective is, for a given number of centroids (i.e. k), to minimize the total within-cluster variation or intra cluster variation (distance from the observation to the centroid).\nThe standard Kmeans algorithm aims to minimize the total sum of the square distances (Euclidean distance) between observations and centroids.\nFirst, we calculate the within-centroid sum of square: \\[W(C_k) = \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} (x_i - \\mu_k)^2 \\tag{1}\\]\nThe objective is to minimize the total within cluster variation, that is the total sum of the distance of each observations to its centroid and that for each of the k-centroids: \\[tot.withinss = \\sum_{k=1}^k W(C_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^k \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} (x_i - \\mu_k)^2   \\tag{2}\\]"

If we have n centroids (that is \\(n = k\\) - as many centroids as observations), the total within-cluster sum of square will be 0. And if we have only one centroid, the total within-one-cluster sum of square will be the sum of square of the mean of each of the variables.\nSo when does adding a centroid does not significantly reduce the total within-cluster sum of square.\n\n\nThe silhouette method"

    "text": "Product rule within Stochastic Calculus\nWhen dealing with Stochastic Differential Equations, we can adapt some of the rules of classical calculus such as the product rule: \\(d(xy) = xdy + ydx\\)\nLet’s say we have 2 stochastic processes: \\[d(X(t)) = \\mu_1 X(t) dt + \\sigma_1 X(t)  dW_t\\] \\[d(Y(t)) = \\mu_2 Y(t) dt + \\sigma_2 Y(t) dW_t\\]\nAnd we define a function \\(F\\) which is a product of these 2 stochastic processes such that \\(F = F(X,Y) = XY\\).\nUsing a Taylor Series Expansion, we can write: \\[F(X + dX, Y + dY) \\approx F(X,Y) + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} dX + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X^2} dX^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial Y^2} dY^2 + \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} dXdY + \\dots\\]\nHence, \\[dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} dX + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X^2} dX^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial Y^2} dY^2 + \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} dXdY + \\dots \\tag{1}\\]\nNow, we can calculate all these partial derivatives and plugged them back in the above equation. \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = Y\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial X^2} = 0\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = X\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial Y^2} = 0\\).\nFinally: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} = 1\\)\nPlugging it all back in Equation 1: \\[dF = Y dX + X dY + dXdY \\tag{2}\\]\n\n\nIntegral by parts\nIn classical calculus, we re-use the product rule to come up with the integration by part: \\(d(xy) = xdy + ydx\\). That is \\(xdy = d(xy) - ydx\\) which we can integrate for and get: \\(\\int xdy = \\int d(xy) - \\int y dx\\) which is the same as \\(\\int x dy = xy - \\int y dx\\).\nLet’s bring this to stochastic calculus. Again \\(F\\) is a function of the product of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X,Y) = XY\\) Using the same logic and our previous result Equation 2, we write \\[d(XY) = Y dX + X dY + dXdY\\] \\[X dY = d(XY) - Y dX - dXdY \\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = \\int_0^t d(X_sY_s) - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_0^t dX_sdY_s\\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = X_tY_t - X_0Y_0 - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_o^t dX_sdY_s\\]\n\n\nQuotient Rule within Stochastic Calculus\nWe will re-use the Taylor Series Expansion (Equation 1) except this time the function \\(F\\) is a function of the quotient of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X, Y) = \\frac{X}{Y}\\). Calculating all the partial derivatives: \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = \\frac{1}{Y}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial X^2} = 0\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{-X}{Y^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial Y^2} = \\frac{2X}{Y^3}\\).\nFinally: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} = \\frac{-1}{Y^2}\\)\nPutting it all back together: \\[dF = \\frac{1}{Y} dX + \\frac{-X}{Y^2} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2X}{Y^3} dY^2+ \\frac{-1}{Y^2} dXdY\\] Which we can re-write as: \\[dF = d \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right) = \\frac{X}{Y} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{X} dX - \\frac{1}{Y} dY - \\frac{1}{XY} dXdY + \\frac{1}{Y^2} dY^2\\right) \\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the quant world.\n\n\n\nwe can word these results in the following way - taken from here:\n\nIto product rule: we buy correlation when we have a product\nIto quotient rule: we sell correlation when we have a ratio, and we are long vol of the denominator."

For this, by definition, we need \\[\\mathbb{E}_s[Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = Y_s \\space, \\space 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\]\nIntegrating Equation 1 both side, we can get an exact form for \\(Y(t)\\) \\[Y(t) = Y(s) + \\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du + \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u)\\]\nTaking the expectation on both side: \\[\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s)= \\mathbb{E} \\left[Y(s) + \\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du + \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u) \\space | \\mathcal{F} \\right]\\]\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s) = Y(s) + \\mathbb{E} \\left[\\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du \\space | \\mathcal{F_s} \\right]\\]\nThis is because, see above, ito integrals are martingales and \\(\\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u)\\) is an ito integral. Hence, its expectation is 0 ==> \\(\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u) \\right] = 0\\)\nIn order for \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s) = Y(s)\\), we now need \\(\\mathbb{E} \\left[\\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du \\space | \\mathcal{F}_s \\right] = 0\\). This means that \\(f(Y_t, t) = 0, \\space \\forall t\\).\nGoing back to the SDE, we can say that \\(dY(t)\\) is a martingale iff \\[dY(t) = g(Y_t, t) \\space dX(t)\\]\n\n\nExponential martingales\nLEt’s consider a stochastic process \\(Y(t)\\) that satisfies the following Stochastic Differential Equation: \\[dY(t) = f(t) \\space dt + g(t) \\space dX(t)\\] with initial condition \\(Y(0) = 0\\). \\(X(t)\\) is a Brownian Motion, \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are time-dependent functions.\nWe can now define a new process such that \\[Z(t) = e^{Y(t)}\\]\nHow can we ensure \\(Z(t)\\) is a martingale? How should we choose \\(f(t)\\) such that \\(Z(t)\\) is a martingale?"

That is \\(xdy = d(xy) - ydx\\) which we can integrate for and get: \\(\\int xdy = \\int d(xy) - \\int y dx\\) which is the same as \\(\\int x dy = xy - \\int y dx\\).\nLet’s bring this to stochastic calculus. Again \\(F\\) is a function of the product of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X,Y) = XY\\) Using the same logic and our previous result Equation 2, we write \\[d(XY) = Y dX + X dY + dXdY\\] \\[X dY = d(XY) - Y dX - dXdY \\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = \\int_0^t d(X_sY_s) - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_0^t dX_sdY_s\\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = X_tY_t - X_0Y_0 - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_o^t dX_sdY_s\\]\n\n\nQuotient Rule within Stochastic Calculus\nWe will re-use the Taylor Series Expansion (Equation 1) except this time the function \\(F\\) is a function of the quotient of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X, Y) = \\frac{X}{Y}\\). Calculating all the partial derivatives: \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = \\frac{1}{Y}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial X^2} = 0\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{-X}{Y^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial Y^2} = \\frac{2X}{Y^3}\\).\nFinally: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} = \\frac{-1}{Y^2}\\)\nPutting it all back together: \\[dF = \\frac{1}{Y} dX + \\frac{-X}{Y^2} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2X}{Y^3} dY^2+ \\frac{-1}{Y^2} dXdY\\] Which we can re-write as: \\[dF = d \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right) = \\frac{X}{Y} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{X} dX - \\frac{1}{Y} dY - \\frac{1}{XY} dXdY + \\frac{1}{Y^2} dY^2\\right) \\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the quant world.\n\n\n\nwe can word these results in the following way - taken from here:\n\nItô product rule: we buy correlation when we have a product\nItô quotient rule: we sell correlation when we have a ratio, and we are long vol of the denominator."

It allows to compare together 2 different distributions (that have different mean and sd).\n\\[CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\]\nOr in the case of a sample \\(CV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\nSkewness is measure of asymmetry of a distribution (or actually lack of). How symmetric around the mean is the distribution? A standard normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and has zero skew. Other examples of zero-skewed distributions are the T Distribution, the uniform distribution and the Laplace distribution. However, other distributions don’t have zero skew.\nIn a zero skew distribution, the mean = the median and the distribution is symmetric.\n\n\nIn a sense, skewness is quantifying for us how far is the median from the mean.\nMathematically, we define skewness as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^3}{\\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^3}} \\tag{1}\\]\nIn the case of a sample, we’ll multiply Equation 2 by a factor of \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2}\\)\n\nskenwess = 0 ==&gt; normallly distributed\n$ -0.5 skewness $ ==&gt; moderately skew\n$$\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\nKurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures “tailedness,” not “peakedness.”\n\n\nBecause, we raised the difference of a data point to its mean to the 4th power, it is really the data points far away from the mean that do participate to the kurtosis.\n\n“increasing kurtosis is associated with the “movement of probability mass from the shoulders of a distribution into its center and tails.” (Someone important who got published and knew his stuff!)\n\nMathematically, we define kurtosis as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^2} \\tag{2}\\]\nSome statistical packages are providing excess kurtosis by subtracting 3 to the kurtosis value. So for a data set that is perfectly normally distributed, we expect the excess kurtosis to be 0.\nThere are 3 categories of kurtosis: leptokurtic (positive excess kurtosis), mesokurtic (aka normal distribution), platykurtic. \n\nA kurtosis greater than 3 =&gt; leptokurtic\nA kurtosis around 3 =&gt; mesokurtic\nA kurtosis less than 3 =&gt; platykurtic\n\nA Student’s T distribution with degree of freedom 4 has infinite kurtosis (huge peak and tails + narrow shoulders)\nMost equities display a leptokurtic behavior (skinny at the mean - most returns are clustered around the mean) and narrow shoulders and fat tails.\n\n\nUsing Python\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\namd = pd.read_csv('../../../raw_data/AMD.csv')\n\nx = amd['adjClose']\n\nreturns_21d = np.log(x / x.shift(21)).dropna()\n\nmean_21dret = np.mean(returns_21d)\nstd_21dret = np.std(returns_21d)\n\nprint(\"The mean rolling 21 days return is: %s\" % round(mean_21dret, 5))\n\nThe mean rolling 21 days return is: -0.00594\n\nprint(\"The standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: %s\" %round(std_21dret, 5))\n\nThe standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: 0.1832\n\n\nThe standard deviation is quite bigger than the mean.

A random process or often called stochastic property is a mathematical object defined as a collection of random variables. A Markov chain has either discrete state space (set of possible values of the random variables) or discrete index set (often representing time) - given the fact, many variations for a Markov chain exists. Usually the term “Markov chain” is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is a Discrete Time Markov chain (DTMC).\nTo develop better intuition about Markov chain, the simpler version of it is to model a basic random walk."

    "text": "Steady-state\nIn some case, there are situation (random-walk) with a long term mean reversal - we say that they have a steady state distribution. This means that in the long run, the \\(p(y, t; y', t')\\) doesn’t depend of the starting point \\(y, t\\); the probability becomes time independent. Think of situations such as interest rate and volatility.\nIn the case of a steady state situation, \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t'} = 0\\) since the process becomes time independent in the long run. And the probability (now written $p_{} (y’) $) satisfies the ordinary differential equation: \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d \\left(B(y')^2 p_{\\infty} \\right)}{d y'^2} - \\frac{d \\left( A(y') p_{\\infty} \\right)}{d y'} = 0 \\tag{8}\\] It isn’t anymore a partial differential equation as the time component vanishes (aka steady-state, long-term reversal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVasicek revisited\n\n\n\nRecall from above the Vasicek model \\[dr = \\gamma (\\bar{r} - r) \\space dt + \\sigma \\space dW_t\\] Using Equation 8, we can write the steady state distribution \\(p_{\\infty} r'\\) following ordinary differential equation. \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 \\frac{d^2  p_{\\infty} }{d r'^2} - \\gamma \\frac{d( \\left(\\bar{r} - r) p_{\\infty} \\right)}{d r'} = 0\\] Integrating both sides, we get: \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 \\frac{d  p_{\\infty} }{d r'} + \\gamma (r - \\bar{r}) p_{\\infty} = K\\] K being a constant. \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 \\frac{d  p_{\\infty} }{d r'} = - \\gamma (r - \\bar{r}) p_{\\infty} + K\\] Letting the constant be 0 (need explanation here) Letting the \\({\\infty}\\) just for convenience purposes.\n\\[\\frac{1}{p} dp = \\frac{-2 \\gamma}{\\sigma^2} (r - \\bar{r}) \\space dr'\\] Integrating both sides, \\[\\int \\frac{1}{p} dp = \\frac{-2 \\gamma}{\\sigma^2} \\int (r - \\bar{r}) \\space dr'\\] \\[log(p) = \\frac{-2 \\gamma}{\\sigma^2} \\frac{1}{2} (r - \\bar{r})^2 + K\\] Using a normalizing constant, as we inverse the log \\[p(r) = A \\cdot e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^2} (r - \\bar{r})^2} \\tag{9}\\]\nWe know that \\(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} p(r) dr= 1\\), hence \\[A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^2} (r - \\bar{r})^2} dr = 1\\] We can integrate this using substitution \\(u = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\space (r - \\bar{r})}{\\sigma}\\) with \\(\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{\\sigma}\\) \\[A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-u^2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}} du = 1\\] \\[A \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-u^2} du = 1\\] \\[A \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}} \\sqrt{\\pi}  = 1\\] \\[A = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}}\\]\nPutting it all back together in Equation 9: \\[p_{\\infty}(r) = A \\cdot e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^2} (r - \\bar{r})^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}} e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^2} (r - \\bar{r})^2}\\] This means: in our case of a steady state stochastic process, the variable \\(r\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\bar{r}}\\) and standard deviation \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\gamma}}\\)"
