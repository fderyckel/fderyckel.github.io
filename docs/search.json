Hence, we can let \\(C^2 = \\alpha \\frac{\\delta y^2}{\\delta t}\\), and we get: \\[\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t'} = C^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial y'^2} \\tag{6}\\]\nThis last (Equation 6) can be recognized as the Forward Kolmogorov Equation or Heat-diffusion equation or also Fokker-Plank equation.\nNote that:\n\nThis is a PDE for p with 2 independent variables \\(y'\\) and \\(t'\\)\n\\(y\\) and \\(t\\) are like parameters. They are fixed, they are starting point\nThis should model a random-walk that is finite in a finite time.\n\nTo solve this PDE, we solve it by (as per the CQF) similarity reduction. We use a solution of the form \\[P = t'^a f \\left( \\frac{y'}{t'^b} \\right) \\space a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\]\nLetting \\(\\xi = \\frac{y'}{t'^b}\\), we are looking for a solution of the form \\[P = t'^a f(\\xi) \\]\nFinding the partial derivatives based on the above solution’s form.\n\\[\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y'} = t'^a \\cdot \\frac{df}{d \\xi} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial y'}\\] Note how f is just a function of \\(\\xi\\) while \\(\\xi\\) is a function of both \\(y'\\) and \\(t'\\); hence the difference in notation for the derivatives.\nSince \\(\\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial y'} = t'^{-b}\\), we have \\[\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y'} = t'^{a-b} \\cdot \\frac{df}{d \\xi} \\]\nAlso, \\(\\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial t'} = -b \\cdot y' \\cdot t'^{-b-1}\\). Using product rule to find \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t'}\\), we get: \\[\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t'} = a t'^{a-1} f(\\xi) + t'^a \\frac{df}{d \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial t'} = a \\cdot t'^{a-1} \\cdot f(\\xi) - b \\cdot t'^{a-b-1} \\cdot y' \\cdot \\frac{df}{d \\xi} \\]"

From a previous post, we already know that financial asset returns do not follow a normal distribution (too peaked at the mean and fat tails).\nWe’ll show these parameters using both R and python.\nWe’ll use the SPY as a low-ish vol asset and AMD as an equity with higher vol. We only use the last 5 years of data (from 2018 and beyond)\nLet’s first load our libraries and the 2 data frame worth of prices.\n\nlibrary(readr)    # read_csv()\nlibrary(dplyr)    # mutate(), filter()\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf_spy <- read_csv('../../raw_data/SPY.csv') |> \n  select(date, adjClose) |> \n  arrange(date) |> \n  mutate(return = log(adjClose / lag(adjClose))) |> \n  filter(date > '2018-01-01')\n\ndf_amd <- read_csv('../../raw_data/AMD.csv') |> \n  select(date, adjClose) |> \n  arrange(date) |> \n  mutate(return = log(adjClose / lag(adjClose))) |> \n  filter(date > '2018-01-01')\n\n\nMean\nThe mean is our first moment. We’ll cons\nMathematically speaking, we define the mean as \\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\frac{r_i}{n}\\]\n\n\\(r_i\\) is the return of the i-th observation\n\nusing log return\n\n\\(n\\) is the number of observation\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation\nStandard deviation is the second moment.\n\\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\mu)^2}{n}}\\] In the case of a sample: \\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\\)\nThe variance is the square of the standard deviation. There is this neat little alternative expression of variance (I like the way it sounds).\n\nVariance is the difference between the mean of the square and the square of the mean.\n\nHere is how it goes:\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{n} = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - 2 \\frac{\\sum(x_i \\mu)}{n} + \\frac{\\sum(\\mu)^2}{n}\\]\nConsidering\n\n\\(\\frac{\\sum(x_i \\mu)}{n} = \\mu \\frac{\\sum(x_i)}{n} = \\mu \\mu=\\mu^2\\)\nand considering \\(\\frac{\\sum(\\mu)^2}{n} = n \\frac{\\mu^2}{n} = \\mu^2\\), we can re-write our variance like this\n\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - 2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i)^2}{n} - \\mu^2\\]\n\n\nCoefficient of variation\nThe coefficient of variation is not a statistical moment, but considering it is the ratio of the first 2 moments (ratio of sd to the mean), we include it here as well. It allows to compare together 2 different distributions (that have different mean and sd).\n\\[CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\]\nOr in the case of a sample \\(CV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}\\)\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkewness\n\n\n\nSkewness is measure of asymmetry of a distribution (or actually lack of). How symmetric around the mean is the distribution? A standard normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and has zero skew. Other examples of zero-skewed distributions are the T Distribution, the uniform distribution and the Laplace distribution. However, other distributions don’t have zero skew.\nIn a zero skew distribution, the mean = the median and the distribution is symmetric.\n\n\nIn a sense, skewness is quantifying for us how far is the median from the mean.\nMathematically, we define skewness as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^3}{\\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^3}} \\tag{1}\\]\nIn the case of a sample, we’ll multiply Equation 2 by a factor of \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2}\\)\n\nskenwess = 0 ==> normallly distributed\n$ -0.5 skewness $ ==> moderately skew\n$$\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurtosis\n\n\n\nKurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures “tailedness,” not “peakedness.”\n\n\nBecause, we raised the difference of a data point to its mean to the 4th power, it is really the data points far away from the mean that do participate to the kurtosis.\n\n“increasing kurtosis is associated with the “movement of probability mass from the shoulders of a distribution into its center and tails.” (Someone important who got published and knew his stuff!)\n\nMathematically, we define kurtosis as\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)^2} \\tag{2}\\]\nSome statistical packages are providing excess kurtosis by subtracting 3 to the kurtosis value. So for a data set that is perfectly normally distributed, we expect the excess kurtosis to be 0.\nThere are 3 categories of kurtosis: leptokurtic (positive excess kurtosis), mesokurtic (aka normal distribution), platykurtic. \n\nA kurtosis greater than 3 => leptokurtic\nA kurtosis around 3 => mesokurtic\nA kurtosis less than 3 => platykurtic\n\nA Student’s T distribution with degree of freedom 4 has infinite kurtosis (huge peak and tails + narrow shoulders)\nMost equities display a leptokurtic behavior (skinny at the mean - most returns are clustered around the mean) and narrow shoulders and fat tails.\n\n\nUsing Python\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\namd = pd.read_csv('../../raw_data/AMD.csv')\n\nx = amd['adjClose']\n\nreturns_21d = np.log(x / x.shift(21)).dropna()\n\nmean_21dret = np.mean(returns_21d)\nstd_21dret = np.std(returns_21d)\n\nprint(\"The mean rolling 21 days return is: %s\" % round(mean_21dret, 5))\n\nThe mean rolling 21 days return is: -0.00594\n\nprint(\"The standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: %s\" %round(std_21dret, 5))\n\nThe standard deviation of the rolling 21 days return is: 0.1832\n\n\nThe standard deviation is quite bigger than the mean.

No points of doing a linear regression on a set of data, if data are not showing a linear trend.\n\nHow well the data fits the regression line (correlation) have NO incidence on causality. Correlation is no indication of causation\nVariables have to be normally distributed. This can be checked using histogram or QQ-plot or some other stat tests - Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Skewness and kurtosis can also be used for that. In case of violation of this assumption, a Box-Cox transformation could be used.\nHomoscedasticity in the residuals. Variance in the spread of residuals should be constant. \nError terms are normally distributed (visual: histogram, QQ-plot)\nIn the case of multi-variables linear regression, ensure no correlation between independent variables"

    "text": "The purpose of this article is to get a deeper dive into Kmeans as an unsupervised machine learning algorithms. To see the algorithm at work on some financial data, you can use the post on kmeans and regime change.\nAs mentioned, Kmeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm, aiming to group “observations” based on their distances to a fixed number of “centroids” (aka: the fixed number is K). Each centroids is defined as the mean (in each dimension) of all the points belonging to that centroid. All the points belonging to a centroid makes a cluster: all the observations belonging to the k-centroid makes the k-cluster.\nThe objective is, for a given number of centroids (i.e. k), to minimize the total within-cluster variation or intra cluster variation (distance from the observation to the centroid).\nThe standard Kmeans algorithm aims to minimize the total sum of the square distances (Euclidean distance) between observations and centroids.\nFirst, we calculate the within-centroid sum of square: \\[W(C_k) = \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} (x_i - \\mu_k)^2 \\tag{1}\\]\nThe objective is to minimize the total within cluster variation, that is the total sum of the distance of each observations to its centroid and that for each of the k-centroids: \\[tot.withinss = \\sum_{k=1}^k W(C_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^k \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} (x_i - \\mu_k)^2   \\tag{2}\\]"

    "text": "Product rule within Stochastic Calculus\nWhen dealing with Stochastic Differential Equations, we can adapt some of the rules of classical calculus such as the product rule: \\(d(xy) = xdy + ydx\\)\nLet’s say we have 2 stochastic processes: \\[d(X(t)) = \\mu_1 X(t) dt + \\sigma_1 X(t)  dW_t\\] \\[d(Y(t)) = \\mu_2 Y(t) dt + \\sigma_2 Y(t) dW_t\\]\nAnd we define a function \\(F\\) which is a product of these 2 stochastic processes such that \\(F = F(X,Y) = XY\\).\nUsing a Taylor Series Expansion, we can write: \\[F(X + dX, Y + dY) \\approx F(X,Y) + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} dX + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X^2} dX^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial Y^2} dY^2 + \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} dXdY + \\dots\\]\nHence, \\[dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} dX + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X^2} dX^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial Y^2} dY^2 + \\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} dXdY + \\dots \\tag{1}\\]\nNow, we can calculate all these partial derivatives and plugged them back in the above equation. \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = Y\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial X^2} = 0\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = X\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial Y^2} = 0\\).\nFinally: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} = 1\\)\nPlugging it all back in Equation 1: \\[dF = Y dX + X dY + dXdY \\tag{2}\\]\n\n\nIntegral by parts\nIn classical calculus, we re-use the product rule to come up with the integration by part: \\(d(xy) = xdy + ydx\\). That is \\(xdy = d(xy) - ydx\\) which we can integrate for and get: \\(\\int xdy = \\int d(xy) - \\int y dx\\) which is the same as \\(\\int x dy = xy - \\int y dx\\).\nLet’s bring this to stochastic calculus. Again \\(F\\) is a function of the product of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X,Y) = XY\\) Using the same logic and our previous result Equation 2, we write \\[d(XY) = Y dX + X dY + dXdY\\] \\[X dY = d(XY) - Y dX - dXdY \\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = \\int_0^t d(X_sY_s) - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_0^t dX_sdY_s\\] \\[\\int_0^t X_s dY_s = X_tY_t - X_0Y_0 - \\int_0^t Y_s dX_s - \\int_o^t dX_sdY_s\\]\n\n\nQuotient Rule within Stochastic Calculus\nWe will re-use the Taylor Series Expansion (Equation 1) except this time the function \\(F\\) is a function of the quotient of 2 stochastic processes: \\(F = F(X, Y) = \\frac{X}{Y}\\). Calculating all the partial derivatives: \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = \\frac{1}{Y}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial X^2} = 0\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{-X}{Y^2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial Y^2} = \\frac{2X}{Y^3}\\).\nFinally: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial X \\partial Y} = \\frac{-1}{Y^2}\\)\nPutting it all back together: \\[dF = \\frac{1}{Y} dX + \\frac{-X}{Y^2} dY + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2X}{Y^3} dY^2+ \\frac{-1}{Y^2} dXdY\\] Which we can re-write as: \\[dF = d \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right) = \\frac{X}{Y} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{X} dX - \\frac{1}{Y} dY - \\frac{1}{XY} dXdY + \\frac{1}{Y^2} dY^2\\right) \\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the quant world.\n\n\n\nwe can word these results in the following way - taken from here:\n\nIto product rule: we buy correlation when we have a product\nIto quotient rule: we sell correlation when we have a ratio, and we are long vol of the denominator."

We will use the fact, from above, that ito integrals are martingales. For this, by definition, we need \\[\\mathbb{E}_s[Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = Y_s \\space, \\space 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\]\nIntegrating Equation 1 both side, we can get an exact form for \\(Y(t)\\) \\[Y(t) = Y(s) + \\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du + \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u)\\]\nTaking the expectation on both side: \\[\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s)= \\mathbb{E} \\left[Y(s) + \\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du + \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u) \\space | \\mathcal{F} \\right]\\]\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s) = Y(s) + \\mathbb{E} \\left[\\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du \\space | \\mathcal{F_s} \\right]\\]\nThis is because, see above, ito integrals are martingales and \\(\\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u)\\) is an ito integral. Hence, its expectation is 0 ==> \\(\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\int_s^t g(Y_u, u) \\space dX(u) \\right] = 0\\)\nIn order for \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s) = Y(s)\\), we now need \\(\\mathbb{E} \\left[\\int_s^t f(Y_u, u) \\space du \\space | \\mathcal{F}_s \\right] = 0\\). This means that \\(f(Y_t, t) = 0, \\space \\forall t\\).\nGoing back to the SDE, we can say that \\(dY(t)\\) is a martingale iff \\[dY(t) = g(Y_t, t) \\space dX(t)\\]\n\n\nExponential martingales\nLEt’s consider a stochastic process \\(Y(t)\\) that satisfies the following Stochastic Differential Equation: \\[dY(t) = f(t) \\space dt + g(t) \\space dX(t)\\] with initial condition \\(Y(0) = 0\\). \\(X(t)\\) is a Brownian Motion, \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are time-dependent functions.\nWe can now define a new process such that \\[Z(t) = e^{Y(t)}\\]\nHow can we ensure \\(Z(t)\\) is a martingale? How should we choose \\(f(t)\\) such that \\(Z(t)\\) is a martingale?"
