    "text": "UAT for NbAgg backend.\nThe first line simply reloads matplotlib, uses the nbagg backend and then reloads the backend, just to ensure we have the latest modification to the backend code. Note: The underlying JavaScript will not be updated by this process, so a refresh of the browser after clearing the output and saving is necessary to clear everything fully.\n\nimport matplotlib\nreload(matplotlib)\n\nmatplotlib.use('nbagg')\n\nimport matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg\nreload(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg)\n\n\nUAT 1 - Simple figure creation using pyplot\nShould produce a figure window which is interactive with the pan and zoom buttons. (Do not press the close button, but any others may be used).\n\nimport matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg_core\nreload(matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg_core)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.interactive(False)\n\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nplt.plot(range(10))\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 2 - Creation of another figure, without the need to do plt.figure.\nAs above, a new figure should be created.\n\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 3 - Connection info\nThe printout should show that there are two figures which have active CommSockets, and no figures pending show.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\n\n\nUAT 4 - Closing figures\nClosing a specific figure instance should turn the figure into a plain image - the UI should have been removed. In this case, scroll back to the first figure and assert this is the case.\n\nplt.close(fig1)\nplt.close('all')\n\n\n\nUAT 5 - No show without plt.show in non-interactive mode\nSimply doing a plt.plot should not show a new figure, nor indeed update an existing one (easily verified in UAT 6). The output should simply be a list of Line2D instances.\n\nplt.plot(range(10))\n\n\n\nUAT 6 - Connection information\nWe just created a new figure, but didn’t show it. Connection info should no longer have “Figure 1” (as we closed it in UAT 4) and should have figure 2 and 3, with Figure 3 without any connections. There should be 1 figure pending.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\n\n\nUAT 7 - Show of previously created figure\nWe should be able to show a figure we’ve previously created. The following should produce two figure windows.\n\nplt.show()\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 8 - Interactive mode\nIn interactive mode, creating a line should result in a figure being shown.\n\nplt.interactive(True)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nSubsequent lines should be added to the existing figure, rather than creating a new one.\n\nplt.plot(range(3))\n\nCalling connection_info in interactive mode should not show any pending figures.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\nDisable interactive mode again.\n\nplt.interactive(False)\n\n\n\nUAT 9 - Multiple shows\nUnlike most of the other matplotlib backends, we may want to see a figure multiple times (with or without synchronisation between the views, though the former is not yet implemented). Assert that plt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow() results in another figure window which is synchronised upon pan & zoom.\n\nplt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 10 - Saving notebook\nSaving the notebook (with CTRL+S or File->Save) should result in the saved notebook having static versions of the figures embedded within. The image should be the last update from user interaction and interactive plotting. (check by converting with ipython nbconvert <notebook>)\n\n\nUAT 11 - Creation of a new figure on second show\nCreate a figure, show it, then create a new axes and show it. The result should be a new figure.\nBUG: Sometimes this doesn’t work - not sure why (@pelson).\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.axes()\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 12 - OO interface\nShould produce a new figure and plot it.\n\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg import new_figure_manager,show\n\nmanager = new_figure_manager(1000)\nfig = manager.canvas.figure\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot([1,2,3])\nfig.show()"

    "section": "UAT 13 - Animation",
    "text": "UAT 13 - Animation\nThe following should generate an animated line:\n\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nimport numpy as np\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nx = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)        # x-array\nline, = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n\ndef animate(i):\n    line.set_ydata(np.sin(x+i/10.0))  # update the data\n    return line,\n\n#Init only required for blitting to give a clean slate.\ndef init():\n    line.set_ydata(np.ma.array(x, mask=True))\n    return line,\n\nani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(1, 200), init_func=init,\n                              interval=100., blit=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\nUAT 14 - Keyboard shortcuts in IPython after close of figure\nAfter closing the previous figure (with the close button above the figure) the IPython keyboard shortcuts should still function.\n\n\nUAT 15 - Figure face colours\nThe nbagg honours all colours apart from that of the figure.patch. The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.) The next set of tests ensures that both “regular” and “single-shot” timers work properly.\nThe following should show a simple clock that updates twice a second:\n\nimport time\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\n\ndef update(text):\n    text.set(text=time.ctime())\n    text.axes.figure.canvas.draw()\n    \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\ntimer.start()\nplt.show()\n\nHowever, the following should only update once and then stop:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center') \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\n\nplt.show()\n\nAnd the next two examples should never show any visible text at all:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 18 - stopping figure when removed from DOM\nWhen the div that contains from the figure is removed from the DOM the figure should shut down it’s comm, and if the python-side figure has no more active comms, it should destroy the figure. Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure. After this, re-running the cell above should result in a new figure number.\n\nfig.canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 19 - Blitting\nClicking on the figure should plot a green horizontal line moving up the axes.\n\nimport itertools\n\ncnt = itertools.count()\nbg = None\n\ndef onclick_handle(event):\n    \"\"\"Should draw elevating green line on each mouse click\"\"\"\n    global bg\n    if bg is None:\n        bg = ax.figure.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) \n    ax.figure.canvas.restore_region(bg)\n\n    cur_y = (next(cnt) % 10) * 0.1\n    ln.set_ydata([cur_y, cur_y])\n    ax.draw_artist(ln)\n    ax.figure.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'r')\nln, = ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 0], 'g', animated=True)\nplt.show()\nax.figure.canvas.draw()\n\nax.figure.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick_handle)"

An histogram of the returns will confirm that.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.hist(returns_21d, bins = 'rice', label = 'Rolling 21-days return')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe are seeing a large left tail with indeed the mean looking around 0.

How symmetric around the mean is the distribution? A standard normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and has zero skew. Other examples of zero-skewed distributions are the T Distribution, the uniform distribution and the Laplace distribution. However, other distributions don’t have zero skew.\nIn a zero skew distribution, the mean = the median.\n\n\n\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, skewtest\n\nskew(returns_21d)\n\n-0.2776856914467193\n\n\nThe skew value is quite large and negative which confirms the fat left tail we saw on the histogram\n\nskewtest(returns_21d)\n\nSkewtestResult(statistic=-11.533410550708874, pvalue=8.95254274542113e-31)\n\n\nVery small p-value. We reject the null-hypothesis. The distribution is not symetrical.\nkurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be infinitely peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can be perfectly flat-topped with infinite kurtosis. Thus, kurtosis measures “tailedness,” not “peakedness.”"

A random process or often called stochastic property is a mathematical object defined as a collection of random variables. A Markov chain has either discrete state space (set of possible values of the random variables) or discrete index set (often representing time) - given the fact, many variations for a Markov chain exists. Usually the term “Markov chain” is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is a Discrete Time Markov chain (DTMC).\nTo develop better intuition about Markov chain, the simpler version of it is to model a basic random walk."

The most common way to measure distance is the Euclidean Distance.\nWith multivariate data set, it is important to normalize the data.\nA usual rule of thumb is to set the number of clusters as the square root of the number of observation."

In other words, \\(\\mu_t\\) is the expected value of the time series at point t.\n\nThe Variance of the time series is defined as \\(\\sigma_t ^2 = Var(X_t) = \\textbf{E}[(X_t - \\mu_t)^2]\\).\nIn general, \\(\\mu_t\\) and \\(\\sigma_t ^2\\) are different at different point in time.\n\nNow, we define the autocovariance function of the time series as \\[\\gamma(s, t) = Cov(X_s, X_t) = \\textbf{E}[(X_s - \\mu_s)(X_t - \\mu_t)]\\]. In the same vein, we define the autocorrelation function of the time series as \\[\\rho(s,t) = Corr(X_s, X_t) = \\frac {\\gamma (s, t)}{\\sigma_s \\sigma_t} = \\frac{Cov(X_s, X_t)}{\\sqrt{Var(X_s) Var(X_t)}}\\]"

An absorbing Markov chain has at least one absorbing state.\nA state is termed reflecting if once the chain leaves it, it cannot return to it.\nThe period d of a state i is the number such that, starting in i, the chain can return to i only in the number of steps that are multiples of d. A state with period d = 1 is called aperiodic. Periodicity is a class property.\n\nFor a reflecting state, the period is infinite, since the chain never comes back to this state.\nAbsorbing states necessarily have loops and thus are aperiodic states.\n\na state is called recurrent if with probability 1 the chain ever reenters that state. Otherwise, the state is called transient."
