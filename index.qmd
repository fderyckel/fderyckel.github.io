This [blog](blog.qmd) / Github website is mostly to keep track of quantitative finance concepts I am going through with the CQF and beyond. 

# About

My name is François de Ryckel. I have grown up in Belgium then I emigrated from there to finish up my study and start working. I lived in several places over the last 20 years. I’m a math / philosophy teacher with some stunts at business. I created 2 companies in Zambia: a fruits farm and a fresh produce trading company.  

* Lived in Paris, France, for 2 years to complete my undergrad and start my master
* Lived in Freiburg & Leipzig, Germany, for 3 years to complete my master and do some teaching gigs at Alliance Française, Leipzig Universitat and Leipzig International School 
* Lived in Dhaka, Bangladesh for 3 years to teach at the International School Dhaka 
* Lived in Zambia for 9 years to teach math, stats and philosophy at the American International School of Lusaka. I also started a citrus & mangoes farm (over 9,000 trees) and a produce (fresh fish, fruits, and meat) trading company
* Lived Thuwal, Saudi Arabia on the shore of the beautiful Red Sea for 5 years.  I worked as math teacher on the KAUST university Campus at TKS (The KAUST School) 
* Currently living in Bangkok (Thailand) as a curriculum coordinator for the KIS School.  

As a teacher, I’m always looking for good examples to incorporate in my practices.
Lately I am especially interested in machine learning applications in finance and education.
